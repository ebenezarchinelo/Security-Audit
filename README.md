This project demonstrates an internal IT audit for Botium Toys, a small U.S. toy business with growing online operations. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), I assessed the companyâ€™s security posture, identified risks to critical assets, and evaluated compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, NIST 800-53, and ISO 27001. Tools like Nessus, Splunk, and Wireshark were used to analyze vulnerabilities and logs, with risks mapped to MITRE ATT&CK for Threat Intelligence. This audit showcases my skills in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), Security Operations Center (SOC) operations, and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).
